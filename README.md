# Extracting fast receptive fields from slow imaging frame rates

This code demonstrates how fast neural receptive fields can be extracted from multi-photon microscopy with slow frame rates. Details can be found in our upcoming paper.

To use this code, make sure MATLAB is set to this directory and run ``` ArcLightPlots_Script.m ```. To plot responses using different alignment methods, change the value of ```choosePlot``` on line ```8```. Setting ```chosePlot``` to ```1``` will use data acquired through a linescan protocol, while all other values will use data acquired as 2d images. Besides the linescan protocol, all other methods use the same underlying data, but align stimulus and response in different ways. We show that even with slow frame rates, choosing the correct alignment allows us to recover the fast neural receptive field.
